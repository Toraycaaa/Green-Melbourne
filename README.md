# Green Melbourne

## Introduction

Environment is one of the interesting topics for the Melbourne city government. Trees are a major part of this 

environment reducing air pollution, providing habitat etc. In this project, a html-based visualization is developed 

with different layers suited best in desktop view, targeting the government to show the information of various 

trees that are planted and the planting schedule for the next decade in different locations along with an analysis 

of soil types in these locations.
